# Sprint 7 project
For sptint seven we tested urban grocery's application using java scripts. The project tested urban grocery's applications using java script to verify if they passed according to each data point. Then we tested the body in visual studio code to see if the body matched the requirements. The technologies used were api doc from warehouses to grasp the body and endpoints. Then visual studio code was created in IDE called Visual Studio Code. Git was also used to push and keep the implemented project available for anyone. Node.js was utilized to input the server into its database, create and run the tests. These are the instructions on how to run the tests:
1. Clone the repository to your local directory in terminal. 
2. In terminal in this directory run: `$ npm install`
3. Start the Practicum server and copy its address
4. Add the server address to `config.js` file in the `API_URL` variable value
5. Run all the tests: `npx jest`
